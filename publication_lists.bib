abstract = "Polymer flooding is a mature enhanced oil recovery technique that has been successfully applied in many field projects. By injecting polymer into a reservoir, the viscosity of water is increased, and the efficiency of water flooding is improved. As a result, more oil can be recovered. This paper presents numerical simulations of a polymer flooding process using parallel computers, where the numerical modeling of polymer retention, inaccessible pore volumes, a permeability reduction and polymer absorption are considered. Darcy's law is employed to model the behavior of a fluid in porous media, and the upstream finite difference (volume) method is applied to discretize the mass conservation equations. Numerical methods, including discretization schemes, linear solver methods, nonlinearization methods and parallel techniques are introduced. Numerical experiments show that, on one hand, computed results match those from the commercial simulator, Eclipse, Schlumberger, which is widely applied by the petroleum industry, and, on the other hand, our simulator has excellent speedup, which is demonstrated by large-scale applications with up to 27 million grid blocks using up to 2048 CPU cores."

We are particularly looking at the effects of natural order sorting, Hilbert space filling curve and Morton space filling curve sorting. The data layout changes because of sorting and implementation procedure have been described in detail. We have found that the particles sorting does not only improve the general SPH kernels performance, but also has an influence on the sparse matrix structure of the pressure Poisson equation. We have also discussed and compared the performance difference between space filling curve sorting methods and natural order sorting both in serial and parallel with the dam break test case which has typical violent flow feature."
